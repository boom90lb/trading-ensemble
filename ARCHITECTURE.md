# Architecture

How the pieces connect, end to end. The README covers *why* (methodology) and
*how to run* (usage); this is the *what calls what* map. `docs/operations.md`
covers operational gotchas.

## Data flow

```
Twelvedata API ──► DataLoader ──► FeatureEngineer ──► PurgedWalkForward ──► EnsembleModel ──► TradingStrategy ──► report
   (1day bars,      (range-keyed     (technical         (AFML §7.4          (forecast +        (signal→order→
    adjust=splits)   parquet cache)   indicators,        purge+embargo)      policy members,    fill@next-open,
                                      train-only clip)                       vol-sized blend)    costs, borrow)
```

### 1. Ingestion — `src/data_loader.py`
- `DataLoader.fetch_historical_data` pulls split-adjusted daily bars, caches to
  `data/{symbol}_{interval}_{start}_{end}.parquet`, returns a tz-aware
  (America/New_York) OHLCV frame. Interval is normalized to the vendor's
  `1day`/`1week`/`1month` only at the request boundary.
- `fetch_dividends` pulls ex-date→amount cash dividends (credited in the
  backtest, not back-adjusted into prices).

### 2. Features — `src/features.py`
- `create_features` (causal technical indicators) → `create_lagged_features` →
  `create_target_variable` (forward return `target_{h}`). Computed once on the
  full series (rolling/ewm/pct_change are causal).
- `fit_scalers` / `transform_features` apply **train-only** clip bounds —
  refit per WFO fold so test-fold outliers never leak into the scaler.

### 3. Splitting — `src/validation/walk_forward.py`
- `PurgedWalkForward` yields expanding (or rolling) train/test index pairs with
  a **purge** (drop train rows whose label window overlaps test) and an
  **embargo** (skip a buffer after each test). One splitter drives both the
  outer training loop and the meta-learner's OOF.

### 4. Models — `src/models/`
- `registry.py` partitions members into **forecast** (`arima`, `prophet`,
  `lstm`, `xgboost` — emit ŷ price) and **policy** (`lstm_ppo`, `xlstm_ppo`,
  `xlstm_grpo` — emit positions). `base.py` is the shared interface;
  `required_history` tells the backtest how many trailing bars each member needs.
- `mapping.py` bridges the two: `forecast_to_position` vol-sizes a price
  forecast into a position ∈ [−1, 1]; `ideal_position` is the perfect-foresight
  target the meta-learner regresses against.
- `ensemble.py` is the orchestrator:
  - `fit` fits each member, then `_fit_meta_learner_weights` solves a
    constrained NNLS (SLSQP, w≥0, Σw=1) over **OOF** positions vs. the ideal
    target, and fits the conformal calibrator on the same residuals.
  - `predict` routes each member through the forecast→position or clip path and
    returns the weighted blend in position space.
  - `save`/`load` persist ensemble metadata **and delegate to each member's own
    save/load** (forecast members write per-member subdirs; RL members store a
    path). A loaded ensemble must come back with every member `is_fitted`.
  - `predict_band` / `update_aci` provide EnbPI+ACI conformal bands.

### 5. Execution + accounting — `src/execution/`, `src/trading.py`
- `ExecutionModel` queues `Order`s and fills them at **t+1** (MOO at open, MOC
  at close — never same-bar), applying half-spread + linear impact slippage,
  bps commission, and daily borrow on shorts (`costs.py`).
- `TradingStrategy.run_segment` is the per-bar loop: predict → `calculate_signal`
  (position sign → LONG/SHORT/FLAT; magnitude + inter-model agreement + conformal
  band width → confidence) → `submit_signal_order` → next-bar fill → mark-to-
  market → borrow → record. `backtest` = `_reset_state → run_segment →
  drop_pending → _finalize_results`; the WFO loops call the primitives directly.

### 6. Evaluation — `src/validation/metrics.py`, `src/baselines/`
- `metrics.py`: PSR, PBO (CSCV), DSR (False Strategy Theorem), Calmar.
- `baselines/`: BuyAndHold, MACrossover, TSMOM — run through the same execution
  path so PBO is computed across a fold-aligned strategy set.
- `conformal/`: EnbPI block-cross-conformal + ACI online α-adaptation.

## Scripts (`scripts/`) — the entry points

| Script | Role | Key output |
|---|---|---|
| `training.py` | per-symbol purged-WFO fit | `runs/{run}/{symbol}/fold_*/ensemble_model/` + `split_idx.npz` |
| `backtest.py` | replay per-fold models, net WFO-OOS + baselines + PBO/DSR | `results/wfo_backtest_*/summary.json` |
| `sweep.py` | ensemble-layer grid → honest DSR (forecast-only) | `trial_sharpes.json`, `selected_config.json` |
| `rl_seed_eval.py` | multi-seed RL overfitting study | `rl_seed_eval.json` |
| `prediction.py` | point predictions from a saved model | CSV + plot |

`config.py` is the single source of truth (weights, hyperparams, dirs, dataclass
configs). `tracking/mlflow_utils.py` wraps MLflow logging. `logging_utils.py`
installs console+rotating-file logging.

## Cross-cutting invariants worth knowing

- **Bars are tz-aware (ET)** from ingestion onward; `clean_data_for_training`
  asserts it. Prophet strips the zone internally because it requires tz-naive `ds`.
- **Label columns (`target_`/`direction_`) are dropped before fit AND before
  predict.** The training loop and `run_segment` must agree on the column set or
  XGBoost raises a feature-name mismatch.
- **The ensemble output is a position, not a price** — forecast members are
  mapped before blending (the B8 fix); never average ŷ with positions.
- **Members can be silently dropped from the blend** if `predict` returns a
  length ≠ `len(X)` — currently the forecast `lstm`. See `docs/operations.md`.
